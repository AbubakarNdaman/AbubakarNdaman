👋 Hi, I'm Ndaman Abubakar

I am a Master's student in Digital Urban Studies with a research focus on transport accessibility, spatial equity, and climate-resilient urban mobility.

My Master's thesis examines transport network resilience and accessibility under climate stressors using Python-based spatial analysis.

My work combines GIS, network analysis, and data-driven modelling to support transport planning and policy decisions, particularly in data-scarce cities.

**Research Interests**
